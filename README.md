# ScrapyScrape
ScrapyScrape is a repository for web scraping projects using Scrapy, a powerful Python framework. It focuses on building efficient spiders to extract data from various websites, automate crawling processes, and collect structured information for data analysis, research, or application development.

## Getting started with Scrapy
### Create your virtual environment with Conda using the following command:

```bash
conda create --prefix ./venv python
```

### You now need to activate the environment and install Scrapy. Here's what to do next:

#### 1. Activate the Conda Environment:
Activate the environment you just created:
```bash
conda activate ./venv
```
#### 2. Install Scrapy:
Once the environment is active, install Scrapy by running:

```bash
pip install scrapy
```
#### 3. Verify Scrapy Installation:
After installation, verify it by running:

```bash
scrapy --version
```
If Scrapy is installed correctly, it will display the installed version. Now you're ready to start scraping with Scrapy in your Conda-managed environment!
